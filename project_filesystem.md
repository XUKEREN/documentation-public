# Project Filesystem Status

Starting around mid-March, users began reporting multiple issues due to high load on our filesystem that hosts /rcf-proj2 and /rcf-proj3 . This has caused problems for users trying to log in, access files, or run interactive jobs.

We've since stabilized the filesystem but have made it read-only to decrease the load and prevent further file access issues. The filesystem will remain in this state until June when we can deploy a new, previously planned filesystem and migrate all project data.

**In the meantime, we are requesting that users use either their /scratch or /staging directory for their production runs.**

Both the scratch and staging directories have much less available disk space than the project filesystem, so please **only copy necessary files** to these directories. In general, if it doesn't need to be edited or updated, keep it in your read-only project directory. New files can be written to either scratch or staging, but **scratch is preferred**.

Most programs have a method to use input files even if they aren't in the working directory. If you need help getting your program to read files from your project directory and write out in your scratch or staging directory, please contact us at hpc@usc.edu

# How to use scratch

Your scratch directory is located at:

    /scratch/<user_name>

## What data should move to scratch?

Your scratch directory is accessible only to you, so any files that you wish to share with your lab members should be saved to staging. **Use of scratch is preferred over staging**, if possible, since it has more available space.

# How to use staging

Your staging directory is located at:

    /staging/<proj_name>/<user_name>

Users involved in multiple projects will have multiple staging directories they can write to, in the same way that they have different project directories for the different projects they belong to.

## What data should move to staging?

Staging is meant to be a collaborative space for research groups. Save data that you intend to share with your group here.

# Backups

Scratch and staging are intended as temporary filesystems and there is currently **no backup process** to protect data in the event of accidental deletion or hardware failure. We have disabled any automatic data purging policies on scratch and staging so your files will not be automatically deleted, but please **copy important files out of scratch and staging** as soon as possible to protect them.

# Installing software

Installing software on staging and scratch should be as easy as installing it to your project directory. However, there are some special cases. If you require further assistance, please contact us at hpc@usc.edu.

## Python

Python allows you to install and load packages from arbitrary directories.

Assume you have a directory of the form:

    package_root=/scratch/<user_name>/python_packages

You can install packages like so:

    pip3 install <package_name> --root=$package_root

To load a package, ensure you have appended your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable like so:

    export PYTHONPATH=${package_root}/lib/python3.7/site-packages:${PYTHONPATH}

## R

R allows you to install and load packages from arbitrary directories.

To install an R package, run a command of the form:

    install.packages("package_name", lib.loc="package_path")

Where `package_path` is the absolute path to where you want your R packages to be installed. It can be something of the form:

    /staging/<user_name>/r_packages/3.6

*Note: We recommend keeping packages separated by R version (Major.Minor) to avoid compatibility issues.*

To load an R package, run a command of the form:

    library("package_name",lib.loc="package_path")
